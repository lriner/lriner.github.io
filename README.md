This Twine Narrative was written to inform the reader of the major events in Queen Elizabeth I's life, while including a fabricated theatrical element of adding yourself personally into the story, as the young Queen's friend from her childhood. From the beginning, of Elizabeth's birth, all the way until her death, we follow the story of what happened, her mother's execution, the many stepmothers she had, and the sibling rivalry with her sister Mary.
